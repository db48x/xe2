#+TITLE: VM0 Design version 2

This is another design document for the RLX demo game Void Mission
Zero.

* Setting

You are a humanoid mercenary equipped with a rusty wrench, a basic
environment suit, and a particle gun. You work for a powerful
megacorporation as they battle with other companies to monopolize and
exploit the technology and resources of a newly discovered ancient
"machine planet".

* Stats

You have the following stats to keep track of:

  - Action points (AP). Every action has an AP cost.
  - Speed (SPD).  Number of action points to spend each turn.
  - Hit points (HP). When this reaches zero, you die.
  - Energy (EN).  Energy weapons use up these points when fired. When
     this reaches zero, you cannot fire energy weapons until you
     recharge at least part of the gauge.
  - Oxygen level (OX). When this reaches zero, you rapidly lose HP
    until you die.

You can pick up items like Energy capsules to refill the EN gauge,
Oxygen tanks for the OX gauge, and Medpacks for the HP gauge.

* Terrain

At the beginning of each randomly generated mission, the Corporation
will air-drop you into the area of operations, and you begin fighting.

Mission terrain varies, and will include sand with rocky outcroppings,
ice canyons, machine highways, deep mazes, and massive droid-infested
factories.

* Combat

** TODO Ranged combat					  :alpha:

Ranged combat dominates the game. There are two firing modes;
directional mode, in which you fire in a straight line along one of
the eight compass directions; and targeted mode, in which a targeting
cursor can be moved around the screen to fire at particular enemies:

:
:    	   	$
:    @.
:      ......
:      	    ..:::
:	   $  :$:
:	      :::
:
:    KEY: @=player $=enemy .=shot :=cursor

** TODO Melee combat					  :alpha:

Melee combat serves two purposes:

  1. The rusty wrench is a ready fall-back weapon in situations where
     you run out of ammo or energy.
  2. Balancing powerful weapons. For example an energy blade weapon
     could be very devastating, but not useful against very fast
     opponents.

** TODO Energy blade					   :beta:

* Enemies

The enemies may be human employees of other corporations, or hostile
alien/robot forms.

** TODO Perceptors					  :alpha:

"Perceptors" are (floating spheroid eye-bots with shock probes). Red
perceptors tend to seek the player even when far away, but purple
perceptors wander around randomly until the player comes near. These
are very dangerous to the player, and he must have a ranged weapon in
order to deal with them effectively.

** TODO Rooks						  :beta:

Rooks are large, slow, tank-like turrets-on-wheels. Their roof-mounted
particle cannons are accurate and extremely deadly, but have two
disadvantages.  First, they cannot target immediately adjacent
squares, so the player can survive by getting close and attacking with
a melee weapon. Second, the particle cannon is slow to recharge,
allowing a shot only once every few turns.

Being in an open area with several rooks is a bad idea---they'll blow
you away. Instead you must lure them one by one into corridors and
fight in close range---or freeze the group with EMP grenades and blast
away.

** TODO Bases						  :beta:

* TODO Shield						  :alpha:

The shield creates a barrier around you.

:
:  +-----+
:  |     |
:  |  @	 |
:  |     |
:  +-----+

:  KEY: @=player +-|=shield

The shield doesn't move with you.

:

:  |     |

:
:  KEY: @=player +-|=shield

The shield fades after a few turns. It can also be damaged by shots:

:
:
:      	     	    ...$
:      	      .......
:  +-- --......
:  |     |
:  |  @ ...........$

* TODO Environmental Conditions				   :beta:

** TODO Oxygen
** TODO Pressure
** TODO Contaminants 
** TODO Radioactivity
** TODO Temperature

* TODO Lighting and Radar				   :beta:

** TODO Write this

* TODO Music and SFX 					   :beta:
