;;; Commentary:

;; A game can draw directly to the screen if it wants. This file
;; defines a reusable "widget" object where you draw to an offscreen
;; image. Widgets are also designed to receive input events via the
;; `handle-key' method; `define-key' and `undefine-key' can be used to
;; manage keybindings.

;; The main RLX loop is set up to dispatch event messages to
;; widgets. After the events have been processed and the widgets have
;; drawn their images to their respective offscreen buffers, the
;; engine copies the buffers to the screen. (see console.lisp)

;; This file contains the basic widget code and some standard widgets.

;;; Code:

(in-package :rlx)

;;; browser.lisp ends here
