;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides some little utilities for working with USB
;; Mass Storage devices on GNU/Linux.
;;
;; It would probably not be hard to make this configurable so that it
;; works with other operating systems. If you use another operating
;; system and would like to help me get it working there, let me know.
;;
;; Features:
;;  - Scan for attached USB Mass Storage devices and find their UUID's
;;    (see `usb-scan-disks')
;;  - Assign unique names to devices (see `usb-disks-alist')
;;  - Automatically create and configure mount points and UUID's in /etc/fstab
;;    (see `usb-write-fstab', `usb-scan-and-configure')
;;  - Mount/unmount disks interactively, with auto-completion
;;    (see `usb-mount' and `usb-unmount')

;; Future:
;;  - TODO support configurable filesystem types
;;  - TODO Report new disks when hotplugged? (periodic scan, automount?)
;;  - TODO Configure USB Audio devices with ALSA/JACK. use jack.el!
;;  - TODO fix mount point permissions

(require 'cl)
(require 'rx)

;;; Naming your disks

(defvar usb-disks-alist ()
  "Association list mapping disk names (i.e. mount points) to
property lists whose contents describe the disks.

The list should contain an entry for each of the disks (i.e. USB
Mass Storage Class devices) that you will be using, assigning a
unique name to each. (If you set `usb-write-fstab-p' to a
non-nil value, then these names will also be used for the
filesystem mount points.)

The following keys are valid in the property lists:

 :uuid             UUID string. 
 :file-system      The file system type. The default is \"xfs\".
 :options          fstab options (i.e. \"user,noauto,quiet\").

The use of disk UUID's makes it less likely that you will mix up
similar-looking devices (such as SD cards). In addition, we don't
have to bother figuring out which device name the disk got
assigned to, because in /etc/fstab you can specify a UUID to
mount, rather than a device file.

If you choose short names for your disks, you can label your SD
cards with one of those permanent markers that writes on dark
surfaces. (I write on the back of the card where there is no
sticker.)

You can find out your devices' UUIDs with the function
`usb-scan-disks', and use `usb-fstab-entries' to generate fstab
entries. The function `usb-write-fstab' will add appropriate
entries to /etc/fstab (via TRAMP by default; use the variable
`usb-fstab-file' to customize this behavior.)

Even simpler, you can use the interactive function
`usb-scan-and-configure' to do both jobs for you. In this case,
changes to /etc/fstab will only be made when the variable
`usb-write-fstab-p' has a non-nil value. (You should set
`usb-disks-alist' before doing this.)

Example:

  (setf usb-disks-alist
        '((\"/zoom/1\" :uuid \"3734-3937\" :file-system \"vfat\")
	  (\"/zoom/2\" :uuid \"2931-A206\" :file-system \"vfat\")
  	  (\"/red500\" :uuid \"e828ddbe-7bd8-442d-8523-a83518bed4de\" 
                       :fstype \"xfs\")))
  (setf usb-write-fstab-p t)
  (usb-scan-and-configure)

After you enter your root password for TRAMP, /etc/fstab will
be updated.

To mount and unmount the disks, use `usb-mount' and `usb-unmount'.
