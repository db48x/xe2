;;; *1 Preface

;; Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) was a mathematician and philosopher.
;; The subject of this essay is not really him, but rather one in
;; particular of his many notational ideas. 

;; If you want to learn more about Peano himself, I suggest starting
;; with the wikipedia page about him:

;; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano

;;; *1.1 Status

;; Pre-alpha release.

;;; *2 Overview

;; Peano was a prolific writer of mathematical papers and books. In
;; order to keep everything organized, he invented a universal scheme
;; for numbering and indexing the sections, paragraphs, formulae,
;; figures, and other components of an arbitrarily long and complex
;; document. His system was later adopted by Bertrand Russell and
;; Alfred North Whitehead for their "Principia Mathematica", and also
;; by Wittgenstein for his 1921 "Tractatus Logico-Philisophicus".

;;; *2.1 

;; This file implements an Emacs minor mode that can automatically
;; number, cross-reference, and browse any kind of plain-text document
;; in an extended version of the Principia Mathematica addressing
;; system. Optional font-locking is provided for the notation.

;;; *2.2

;; This file is (as you may already suspect) organized according to
;; the system it implements. To try it out, evaluate this file or put
;; it in your load-path and do

;; (require 'peano)

;; Then do M-x peano-mode RET to view the source code.

;;; *3 Document Structure

;; A document is a plain text file divided into short "blocks". A
;; block consists of a formatted header line, followed by zero or more
;; lines of any text whatsoever. Blank lines in the file are ignored.

;;; *3.1 Block Numbers

;; Every block is assigned a unique decimal number such as 3.1 or
;; 1.256. Unlike the typical LaTeX numbering system, in which creating
;; a new section can cause subsequent section numbers to change, here
;; we use decimals so that it is always possible to insert new blocks
;; between others without changing their numbers. 

;;; *3.11

;; This last step is important; we can annotate any block by inserting
;; a new block immediately following the first, and annotate the
;; annotations ad infinitum. Furthermore we can use the number as a
;; unnique and permanent identifier for the block. This simplifies the
;; cross-referencing of documents and imposes a consistent structure.

;;; *3.2 Header Formatting

;; A header line consists of a prefix string, followed by a block
;; number, and then finally an optional label. All three are
;; separated from one another by single spaces. The entire header line
;; is part of the block. 

;;; *3.21 Prefix String

;; The prefix string may be any string matching the local
;; `outline-regexp'; this makes it easy to use `orgstruct-mode' to
;; obtain folded overviews, navigation, and structure editing.

;;; *3.22 Block Number Formatting

;; Block numbers are always written in base-10, prefixed with an
;; asterisk, like this: *7.2 The decimal point may be ommitted in the
;; case of whole numbers.

;;; *3.23 Labels

;; The label extends to the end of the header line. Labels are
;; subject to change, and therefore do not identify blocks---only the
;; numbers do.

;;; *3.3 Chapters

;; The only other unit of document organization provided by this
;; system is the "chapter". A chapter is a series of blocks whose
;; numbers are in increasing order. The integer part of a block
;; number identifies the chapter it belongs to. We write *1 to refer
;; to the first chapter, *2 for the second, and so on.

;;; *3.4 Notes

;; Notes and other optional readings are written in-line, and are
;; marked with two asterisks before the number instead of one. There
;; are no footnotes or endnotes of any kind.

;;; *3.5 Appendices

;; Numbers of appendices are prefixed with *A instead of * or **. All
;; the *A numbers must follow all the * and ** numbers; this ensures
;; that a document's body can grow without limit using all available
;; numbers, while still keeping all the appendices at the end of the
;; document.

;;; *3.6 Preamble

;; Any text before the first block in a file is ignored. 

;;; *3.7 Postamble

;; After the appendices, the optional last section in a document is
;; called *Z. A header line whose number is *Z begins a block
;; containing the rest of the file. 

;;; *3.71

;; So *0 and *Z are the like the covers of a book, and are also useful
;; when you need to put some text at the beginning or at the end of a
;; file for technical reasons (i.e. file-local variables.)

;;; **3.99 Additional Conventions

;; These are optional.

;;; **3.991 

;; Chapter *0 should contain authorship and copyright information, and
;; any needed tags or preamble text (such as those used in the Emacs
;; Lisp coding standards.) The label should be of the form:

;;     filename.extension --- short description of contents

;; TODO provide custom auto-insert-mode

;;; **3.992

;; Chapter *1 should introduce the work to the reader and provide an
;; overview of its contents. Within *1, The following block names are
;; standardized:
;;
;;  Overview
;;  Conventions
;;  History
;;  Status
;;  Installation
;;  Roadmap
;;  
;; Other names are ignored.

;;; **3.993

;; Chapter *Z may contain notes, local variables for Emacs, or other
;; text.

;;; **3.994 

;; In a living document there are always things to do. The string
;; "TODO " makes the rest of the line into the text of a todo-list
;; item. Other such "annotations" may be added in the future.
