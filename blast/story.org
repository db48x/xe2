#+TITLE: Blast Tactics Setting and Story Bible

You are an independent contractor serving Rogue Nexus. Officially in
the business of "data services", Rogue Nexus has its hands in many
pockets, and conducts various for-hire espionage and combat missions.

Our client Arch Gamma has a big problem in the Antares system. Xiomacs
Corporation has been systematically taking control of nearby
way-stations with an eye toward dominating Antares and its resources.
Early probe reports detect a significant droid presence (rated 0.071
by International Analysis LLC) but also endurium ores, a nearby
nebula, biosilicate resins, and quite a bit more. 

You'll be provided with a custom stealth Olvac-3 Void Rider ship, a
quantity of endurium, supplies, and basic EVA (Extra-Vehicular
Activity) gear for penetrating derelict freighters.

After we drop you outside the Antares region, travel to the former
Zeta Base and eliminate the droids who have overrun it.
