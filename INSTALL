This program requires a Common Lisp implementation and the
LISPBUILDER-SDL packages. These are available from:
http://lispbuilder.sourceforge.net/lispbuilder-sdl.html

SBCL users can do the following to try out the test game:

1. Link the rlx.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems via "ln -s"

2. Enter these commands at the SBCL prompt if you need to install
   LISPBUILDER-SDL.

  (require :asdf)
  (require :asdf-install)
  (asdf-install:install :lispbuilder-sdl) 
  (asdf-install:install :lispbuilder-sdl-image)

  NOTE: The latest SVN version of lispbuilder is highly recommended
  for correct rendering.  If you see ugly black borders around
  objects, upgrade to the new version: 

  svn co https://lispbuilder.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lispbuilder/trunk lispbuilder

3. Add something like this to a new file called ~/.rlxrc:

  (setf rlx:*module-directories* '("/home/dto/rlx"))

The filename should be wherever you installed the RLX source tree.

4. Then at the SBCL REPL:

  (require :rlx)
  (rlx:play "vm0")
  
5. ESCAPE toggles the command prompt.  Use the numeric keypad to move
   around. T to pick up objects.  E to equip slot 0, or enter "equip
   N" at the command prompt to equip slot N.  Alt-DIRECTION to attack.
