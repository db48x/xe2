This is the INSTALL file for the RLX roguelike engine.
Installation and basic playing instructions are provided. 

1. You need a Common Lisp implementation. Only tested on SBCL right
   now. You must also have the SDL libraries installed. How to do this
   is beyond the scope of this document. See libsdl.org for more
   information. In addition, the LISPBUILDER-SDL libraries are also
   required and these should be compiled from their latest
   SVN. (see below for instructions.)

2. If you have not already done so, download RLX:
  
   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/rlx.git 

3. Then link the rlx.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems directory:

   ln -s ~/src/rlx/rlx.asd ~/.sbcl/systems

4. Download and install a required library called CLON. Example
   commands:

   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/clon.git

   Then link the clon.asd file:

   ln -s ~/src/clon/clon.asd ~/.sbcl/systems

5. The latest development version of LISPBUILDER-SDL is required. Use
   Subversion to check out the source code:

   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   svn checkout http://lispbuilder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ lispbuilder

   Then symlink all the .asd files in that tree into ~/.sbcl/systems
   (or wherever your .ASD files go) like this:

   cd ~/.sbcl/systems
   for i in `find ~/src/lispbuilder -name "*.asd"`; do ln -s $i .; done

6. OPTIONAL: configure module directories

   Add something like this to a new file called ~/.rlxrc:

  (setf rlx:*module-directories* '(#P"/home/dto/src/rlx/"))

The filename should be wherever you installed the RLX source
tree. This is auto-detected as the current directory if you don't set
it. NOTE: These must be pathnames (prefixed with #P) and must contain
a trailing slash.

7. At the shell, cd to the install directory for RLX, run SBCL, and
   then at the REPL:

    (require :rlx)
    (rlx:play "invader")

  If you get an error about TRIVIAL-FEATURES-TESTS, try this:
  (require :trivial-features-tests)
  
See the separate file $INSTALLDIR/invader/manual.org for playing
instructions.
