This is the INSTALL file for the XE2 roguelike engine.
Installation and basic playing instructions are provided. 

1. You need a Common Lisp implementation. Only tested on SBCL right
   now. You must also have the SDL libraries installed. How to do this
   is beyond the scope of this document. See libsdl.org for more
   information. In addition, the LISPBUILDER-SDL libraries are also
   required and these should be compiled from their latest
   SVN. (see below for instructions.)

   Your Linux distribution will have SDL packages for sdl, sdl-image,
   and sdl-mixer, all of which are required libraries.

2. If you have not already done so, download XE2:
  
   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/xe2.git 

3. Then link the xe2.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems directory:

   ln -s ~/src/xe2/xe2.asd ~/.sbcl/systems

4. Download and install a required library called CLON. Example
   commands:

   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/clon.git

   Then link the clon.asd file:

   ln -s ~/src/clon/clon.asd ~/.sbcl/systems

5a. Install some prerequisites for LISPBUILDER-SDL. This should be quick.
    
   (require :asdf)
   (require :asdf-install)
   (asdf-install:install :cffi)

   If it asks about any GPG-KEY-CHECKS, press the appropriate listed
   key to skip them.

   Now install your GNU/Linux distribution's packages for libsdl,
   libsdl-image, libsdl-mixer, and libsdl-gfx.

5b. The latest development version of LISPBUILDER-SDL is required. Use
    Subversion to check out the source code:

   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   svn checkout http://lispbuilder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ lispbuilder

   Then symlink all the .asd files in that tree into ~/.sbcl/systems
   (or wherever your .ASD files go) like this:

   cd ~/.sbcl/systems
   for i in `find ~/src/lispbuilder -name "*.asd"`; do ln -s $i .; done

6. OPTIONAL: configure module directories

   Add something like this to a new file called ~/.xe2rc:

  (setf xe2:*module-directories* '(#P"/home/dto/src/xe2/"))

The filename should be wherever you installed the XE2 source
tree. This is auto-detected as the current directory if you don't set
it. NOTE: These must be pathnames (prefixed with #P) and must contain
a trailing slash.

7. At the shell, cd to the install directory for XE2, run SBCL, and
   then at the REPL:

    (require :xe2)
    (xe2:play "blast")

  If you get an error about TRIVIAL-FEATURES-TESTS, try this:
  (require :trivial-features-tests)
  
See the separate file $INSTALLDIR/invader/manual.org for playing
instructions.

8. Here is my example .xe2rc:

    ;; -*- Mode: lisp -*-

    (setf xe2:*module-directories* '(#P"/home/dto/xe2/" 
    	  			     #P"/home/dto/xe2-modules/"))
    (setf xe2:*user-keyboard-layout* :qwerty)
    (setf xe2:*use-sound* t)
    (setf xe2:*message-logging* t)
     ;; fullscreen is a pain if XE2 hangs
    (setf xe2:*fullscreen* nil)

9. For dvorak users: 

   g c r
    \|/
   h-.-n
    /|\ 
   m w v

   Add (setf xe2:*user-keyboard-layout* :dvorak) to your ~/.xe2rc.
