This is the INSTALL file for the RLX roguelike engine.
Installation and basic playing instructions are provided. 

1. You need a Common Lisp implementation. Only tested on SBCL right
   now.

2. If you have not already done so, download RLX:
  
   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/rlx.git 

3. Then link the rlx.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems directory:

   ln -s ~/src/rlx/rlx.asd ~/.sbcl/systems

4. Download and install a required library called CLON. Example
   commands:

   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/clon.git

   Then link the clon.asd file:

   ln -s ~/src/clon/clon.asd ~/.sbcl/systems

5. The development version of LISPBUILDER-SDL might be required if you
   experience any problems with the ASDF-installable versions. If this
   is the case, use Subversion to check out the source code:   

   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   svn checkout http://lispbuilder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ lispbuilder-read-only	

   Then symlink all the .asd files in that tree into ~/.sbcl/systems
   (or wherever your .ASD files go) like this:

   cd ~/.sbcl/systems
   for i in `find ~/src/lispbuilder -name "*.asd"`; do ln -s $i .; done

6. OPTIONAL: configure module directories

   Add something like this to a new file called ~/.rlxrc:

  (setf rlx:*module-directories* '("/home/dto/src/rlx"))

The filename should be wherever you installed the RLX source
tree. This is auto-detected as the current directory if you don't set
it.

7. At the shell, cd to the install directory for RLX, run SBCL, and
   then at the REPL:

    (require :rlx)
    (rlx:play "invader")

  If you get an error about TRIVIAL-FEATURES-TESTS, try this:
  (require :trivial-features-tests)
  
8. CONTROLS

   Press control Q to wquit at any time. For directional control you
   can choose between QWERTY and DVORAK layouts as follows: 

   QWERTY USERS:

   y k u
    \|/
   h-.-l
    /|\ 
   b j n

   for the directionals. Other keys:

   Alt-DIRECTION for melee attack with wrench, Control-DIRECTION to
   fire with an equipped gun.

   DVORAK USERS: 

   Add the following to your ~/.rlxrc:

   (setf rlx:*user-keyboard-layout* :dvorak)

   Then use:
 
   f t g
    \|/
   d-.-n
    /|\ 
   x h b
   
   for the directionals. Other keys:

   Alt-DIRECTION for melee attack with wrench, Control-DIRECTION to
   fire with an equipped gun.

9. GAMEPLAY

 Explore the airless environment and destroy robots. You must find a
 weapon (either a wrench or a muon pistol) before you can attack
 enemies, so avoid them until then. Wrench attack is Alt-DIRECTION,
 pistol attack is Control-DIRECTION. The blue Berserkers run around
 looking for the player and will chase you if they get within sight
 distance. The purple Biclops are more dangerous, and chase the player
 from anywhere. The medpacks restore your hitpoints. The oxygen tanks
 keep you alive; keep looking for them! Some of the blue boxes contain
 items. Smash them! Find the gun and attack your enemies from a
 distance to keep them from destroying you. The green security
 scanners can fire heat-seeking bullets at you once you are detected.
