#+TITLE: DREZ ideas

* Thoughts

** Trigger beats and loops with your feet (or any other kind of controller)
** Variety of input options: mouse, dance pad, joystick, keyboard, MIDI, network
** Simple, button-based interface usable with simpler controllers (like dance pad)
** Supplement CL audio capabilities with external programs
** Establish a consistent beat via numeric input or tap-tempo
** Layer looped triggers to create a beat
** Basic sequencer subdivides a group into beats/ticks
** Musical trigger event lists; make these the same as XE2 events
** Ecasound programmatic integration?

** Rez-ish color coded interface widgets and simple cell-mode layout
** Atari Basic Programming style UI

* Tasks

** TODO Reexamine old music code.... ligeti, ecaspace
** TODO Decide on music event data format, simple hierarchical OSC-ish namespace?
** TODO Find some external programs to create and process basic samples.

* Music representation
** Events
*** One possibility: (start-time &rest p-fields)
*** Another: (integer-tick &rest p-fields)
*** Pattern: sorted vector of events
