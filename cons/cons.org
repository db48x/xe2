(05:29:07 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: and how about you lose a segment when you're hit?
(05:29:52 PM) Elliott Slaughter: sure
(05:30:07 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: 200+ downloads of xiotank now
(05:30:20 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: and Sanctuary / Xong have gone through the roof in osx terms :)

(05:30:47 PM) Elliott Slaughter: nice
(05:32:10 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: ok so you are a snake.
(05:32:30 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: i'm trying to think what sort of pieces are required
(05:32:40 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: will the body just be hit-points?
(05:33:06 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: ok i've got it
(05:33:19 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: +ooooooooo
(05:33:21 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: + is head of snake
(05:33:25 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: ooooo are items
(05:33:29 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: +
(05:33:30 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: empty snake
(05:34:16 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: PUSH takes an item "o" and picks it up.     so you have  +o
(05:34:28 PM) Elliott Slaughter: yup
(05:34:38 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: so eventually you have +ooooo
(05:34:46 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: and you can use whatever item is topmost
(05:35:11 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: oh, should it be random access though? i.e. 1 2 3 4 5?
(05:35:13 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: keys
(05:35:46 PM) dto1138@gmail.com/D824BEDC: or should one only be able to use the topmost for CALL? i think it's an interesting restriction. I could have ROTATEF instead of swap
