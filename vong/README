This is the help screen. Press F2 to return to play.

You are the white square at the top left corner of the screen. You can
move in any of the four compass directions using the arrow keys,
numeric keypad, or the letters H, J, K, and L. You may also click any
object for a description.

Press CONTROL-direction to fire whatever you are holding in that
direction. Usually you are holding a colored puck but you can pick up
other things.

Press ALT-direction to drop a chevron pointed in that
direction. Chevrons are arrows that change the direction of the puck
and some enemies. You must find chevrons on the ground, they look like
tiny white diamonds.

The enemies leave red trails; don't touch them! Use chevrons to guide
the enemies into the Black Holes. The puck will be destroyed if it
hits a red wire or a black hole, so be careful where you fire.

Press ESCAPE to restart the game if you die, and CONTROL-Q to quit.
