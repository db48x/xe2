(03:54:49 PM) David O'Toole: i think i need to modify the key handling system
(03:55:28 PM) jdz: i'd rather have it fire either in the direction of last move, or the opposite of last move or have the turret direction settable by modifier
(03:55:41 PM) jdz: with modifier key that is
(03:55:55 PM) David O'Toole: wait, explain that? the 3rd one
(03:56:22 PM) jdz: well, you press the modifier and set the turret direction as now, but then when moving the turret stays directed that way
(03:56:41 PM) jdz: the fire key will fire in that direction until it is changed
(03:56:52 PM) jdz: the turret direction
(03:57:12 PM) jdz: just my two cents
(03:57:42 PM) David O'Toole: ahhhhhh
(03:57:43 PM) jdz: that way i could set the direction, run in somewhere dangerous and shoot and run out
(03:57:49 PM) jdz: all without messing up all the controls
(03:57:51 PM) David O'Toole: that would be easy to implement and super cool!
(03:58:14 PM) David O'Toole: ok wait. 
(03:58:18 PM) David O'Toole: so the new scheme would be
(03:58:24 PM) David O'Toole: moving does not change turret angle
(04:01:19 PM) David O'Toole: control direction , changes turret angle?
(04:01:23 PM) David O'Toole: wait we've got to think this out. 
(04:01:49 PM) David O'Toole: i might need to separate control and alt. ALT changes direction, CONTROL fires (even while moving?)
(04:02:06 PM) jdz: yes, that's the idea
(04:02:33 PM) jdz: maybe that's against your idea of game mechanics, i don't know
(04:02:47 PM) jdz: this way it sure will be possible to move _and_ shoot simultaneously
(04:10:28 PM) David O'Toole: i think it's a good idea :)

* Entry mail


** About the entrant

I am David O'Toole and I program games in Common Lisp. My blog is at
http://lispgamesdev.blogspot.com, where I will be making daily
progress reports.

** Re-use declaration

For my entry I will be re-using my own Common Lisp game engine called
XE2 (see http://dto.github.com/notebook/xe2-reference.html for
details.) Among its features are support for grid-based worlds of
interacting objects, sprites, basic lighting and field-of-view, sound,
and other useful code.

Aside from the XE2 library itself, all game logic and assets (sound,
images) will be original and produced during the 7 days of the
challenge.

** Start time

 11:59 PM on Sunday March 7 2010, US Eastern Time.

** Game concept

In this roguelike you control a tank pilot who can enter and exit
different tank vehicles. The tank can fire sound waves in 8
directions. There are square waves, sine waves, and triangle
waves. You select which wave to fire with the Z, X, C keys. The
numeric keypad and/or nethack keys are used for choosing a direction
to move in. Either CONTROL or ALT, combined with a directional key, to
fire the currently selected waveform in that direction.

To eliminate enemy bullets, fire the corresponding wave types at
them. Other activities involve firing waves at oscillators to turn
them on and off. Combining tones can unlock puzzle elements and create
chords. Oscillators have a number frequency or note attached. C4
etc. Tracker game.

Some waves must be identified by sound alone.

The pilot can disembark from the tank and even take over other tanks,
and there are certain areas where the tank cannot go. The pilot is
extremely vulnerable, and has only one hit point.

Death is permanent, the game ends when you run out of hit points. 

The goal is to defeat all the enemies and unlock all the gates.
