STORY

You are an archer and initiate monk of the Sanctuary Order. Humanity
and the four continents of the Known World have fallen into a dark
age, where undead horrors from the deeps of the earth have scoured the
land of its people and polluted its very soil. The third Aentis Oscori
(literally "Dark Age") is predicted by ancient tablets to last 100,000
years, and the warrior-monks of the Sanctuary Order are charged with
protecting the few lands still fertile and the few people still living
in the Known World. In their libraries they preserve the knowledge of
ages past in the hope that a distant future generation may retake the
Earth and restore Humanity to its rightful place.

You live in a time nearly 1,000 years after the falling of the Dark
Age. Armed lightly with bow and arrow, wool clothing, and leather
armor, you set out from Nothbess town heading south through the
wilderness toward your destination, Valisade Monastery. You've been
summoned to Valisade for unknown reasons, and commanded to make haste
through the mountains instead of the safer route to the southwest.

GAMEPLAY

Your monk and his surroundings are viewed from a top-down perspective,
with North at the top of the screen. You can move in any of the eight
directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west,
and northwest) by pressing the corresponding key in one of the two
options below:				    
					     
  Q  W  E        7  8  9       	       	       North
   \ | /   	  \ | /	      	      		 |     
  A -+- D   or 	 4 -+- 6      with     	  West  -+-  East     
   / | \       	  / | \	       	       	       	 |     
  Z  X 	C      	 1  2  3	  	       South   			   
      				  					   
There are four inventory slots, activated by pressing 1, 2, 3, or 4.
One may equip items such as a bow and arrows, or consume healing herbs
and such, by pressing the corresponding digit for the item's inventory
slot. Firing the bow is permitted only straight up, down, left, or
right, and the arrows take time to travel. Firing the bow is
accomplished with SHIFT-direction.
