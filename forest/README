Welcome to Sanctuary, a Novella Rogue-like in Common Lisp.

You are an archer and initiate monk of the Sanctuary Order. Humanity
and the four continents of the Known World have fallen into a dark
age, where undead horrors from the deeps of the earth have scoured the
land of its people and polluted its very soil. The third Aentis Oscori
(literally "Dark Age") is predicted by ancient tablets to last 100,000
years, and the warrior-monks of the Sanctuary Order are charged with
protecting the few lands still fertile and the few people still living
in the Known World. In their libraries they preserve the knowledge of
ages past in the hope that a distant future generation may retake the
Earth and restore Humanity to its rightful place.

You live in a time nearly 1,000 years after the falling of the Dark
Age. Armed lightly with bow and arrow, wool clothing, and leather
armor, you set out from Nothbess town heading south through the
wilderness toward your destination, Valisade Monastery. You've been
summoned to Valisade for unknown reasons, and commanded to make haste
through the mountains instead of the safer route to the southwest.
