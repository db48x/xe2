** TODO SDL / LISP deps Licensing due diligence
(03:33:49 PM) Luke Crook: dto:  think the only license you need to wory about is the SDL one. And as long as you include the README-SDL.txt you should be fione.
(03:34:04 PM) David O'Toole: i will have an attorney read it for me
(03:34:07 PM) Luke Crook: dto: Other games include the SDL binaries in the instalers.
(03:34:10 PM) David O'Toole: ok.
(03:35:09 PM) Luke Crook: The lb-sdl stuff is all MIT or BSD I think. So no worries there.
