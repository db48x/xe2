This is the special README file for GNU/Linux users of precompiled
binaries of Blast Tactics.

(1) You must have installed your distribution's packages of SDL,
    SDL_image, and SDL_mixer.

(2) RLX unfortunately needs a config file "~/.rlxrc" in your home dir.
    The file "example-rlxrc" can be edited and copied there.

(3) Enjoy!
