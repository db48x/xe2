This is the special README file for GNU/Linux users of precompiled
XE2 games. 

(1) You must have installed your distribution's packages of SDL,
    SDL_image, and SDL_mixer, also SDL_gfx.

(2) XE2 may need a configuration file "~/.xe2rc" in your home dir.
    The file "example-xe2rc" can be copied there and edited to reflect
    your system's configuration.

(3) Enjoy!
